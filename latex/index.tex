This is modern multi-\/platform editor. Simple, powerful, configurable, extendable. Goodies like macro recording / playback, spell check, column select, multiple clipboards, unlimited undo ... makes it an editor that I use every day.

This is an open source text editor. Written in python. The motivation for this project was to create a modern multi-\/platform editor. Simple, powerful, configurable, extendable. To run this module without installation put the supporting files in the \textquotesingle{}pedlib\textquotesingle{} subdirectory under the main file\textquotesingle{}s direcory.

(like \textquotesingle{}cp -\/a $\ast$ to\+\_\+target\textquotesingle{})

This project is a successor of pyedit, after porting it to GTK3. Py\+Ed\+Pro will run anywhere Py\+GObject can run.

Working and tested platforms currently are\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}  Win 7 .. Win 10 ...
  Centos 6 .. 7 Ubuntu 14 ... 16 ...  20.x (should run on any linux )
  Windows (Native) plus MSYS2, Mingw,
  Raspberry PI 3, Raspberry PI 4, ...
  Mac ** Some functions are disabled - in particular async processing
\end{DoxyVerb}
 I mainly run it on Ubuntu, and in Win32 / MSYS2, some Fedora, Windows 10, and the Raspberry-\/\+Pi. It behaves consistently on all these platforms, it is an absolute joy to edit in a different platform without the learning curve of new keystrokes. If you want an editor that works the same way in all your workspaces, Py\+Ed\+Pro is the one.
