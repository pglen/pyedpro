                                   INSTALL

   Just copy the files anywhere and type ./pyedpro.py The only pre-requisites
 are is to have the ./pyedlib sub directory in the same directory as pyedpro.py and
 ../pycommon in the parent.

  PyEdpro requires GTK3, PyGobject and related libraries. Most distros
come with them pre-installed, so PyEdPro.py should run on most any system
including Linux, Windoze and Macz. One of the motivations, of course is to
have the same text editor on all platforms. Currently running (editing)
on a chromebook in a debian window.

 (PyEdPro is extensively tested on UBU/FEDO Linux, Raspberry PI and Windows)

 Migration:

    The GUI part is used by other project to accomodate thet the common GUI
    items are moved to ../pycommon

    check out 'pycommon' into ../

 Updates:

    3.8 py changes OK  (timer updates)
    switched to python 3.x  (2.x will still works)
    setup.py install updated

  Obsolete:

    .deb file created           (old)
    .rpm file created           (old)

To install pygtobj on python 2/3 issue the msys32/64 commands:

    pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gtk3 mingw-w64-i686-python2-gobject \
                 mingw-w64-i686-python3-gobject

Or on 64 bit:   (support incomplete as of dec/2018 - now complete (may/2019))

    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-gobject python-gi-cairo

To install pyedpro on Ubuntu (py2 and py3):

    sudo apt install python-gi python-gi-cairo python3-gi python3-gi-cairo \
            gir1.2-gtk-3.0

    Additional modules:
        webview, webkit2

To install pyedpro on Windows:

 a.) MSYS

    Go to http://www.msys2.org/ and download the x86_64 installer

    Follow the instructions on the page for setting up the basic environment

    Run C:\msys64\mingw64.exe - a terminal window should pop up

    Execute pacman -Suy

    Execute pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-gtk3 mingw-w64-x86_64-python3 \
                         mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-gobject

    To test that GTK 3 is working you can run gtk3-demo
    To test Copy the hello.py script you created to C:\msys64\home\<username>

    In the mingw32 terminal execute python3 hello.py - a window should appear.


 a.) Windows Native

    There is no good support for pyGObject in Windows. (2022) Some
    fledglings, but no real progress, no stable way of deploying pyGTK/pyGObj.

    #Download and install python 3.4
    #Download and install pygobject for windows from sourceforge

    This may change in the future; pygobject windows src build is broken

  Links (may/2019):

        Gobject:
             https://sourceforge.net/projects/pygobjectwin32/

    To display the keymap and documentation, PyEdPro needs pangview.py (included)

If you do not have root access, PyEdPro will run without installation from any directory.
   Make sure that the subdirectory pyedlib is under the directory PyEdPro.py is in.

 You may also install PyEdPro in the user's private bin directory
 (if it is in the user's path) with the command like cp -a * ~/bin

Additional tweaks neede for different platforms:

  On Unix you may need to execute dos2unix pyedpro.py to allow it to run from
command line.

  Some platforms will need the 'python-gi-cairo' module. The symptom is that the
editor's text field remains blank. PyedPro will issue appropriate messages on the
controlling terminal for the missing library, install it with:

  sudo apt install python-gi-cairo

 If you want to use the built in browser, install WebKit2

  sudo apt install gir1.2-webkit2-4.0


Enjoy.
