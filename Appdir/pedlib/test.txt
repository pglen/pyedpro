## Python editor.

   Welcome to the PyEdPro. This is modern multi-platform editor. Simple, powerful,
configurable, extendable. Goodies like macro recording / playback, spell check,
column select, multiple clipboards, unlimited undo ... makes it an editor
that I use every day.

 This project is a successor of pyedit, after porting it to GTK3. PyEdPro
 will run anywhere PyGObject can run.

  Working and tested platforms currently are:

        Win 7 .. Win 10 ...
        Centos 6 .. 7 Ubuntu 14 ... 16 ...  20.x (should run on any linux )
        Windows (Native) plus MSYS2, Mingw,
        Raspberry PI 3, Raspberry PI 4, ...

  I mainly run it on Ubuntu, and in Win32 / MSYS2, some Fedora, Windows 10,
and the Raspberry-Pi. It behaves consistently on all these platforms,
it is an absolute joy to edit in a different platform without the learning
curve of new keystrokes.  If you want an editor  that works the
same way in all your workspaces, PyEdPro is the one.
