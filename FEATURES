 News:

    Added directory search file load. Loads all matching files. The global buffer
  search / replace will operate on those files. Invaluable for project wide
  variable name changes, with active undo on every change.

    Added directory search. Looks for strings and displays a summary of matches
  in the current directory. Selecting a file will load it. Most useful for
  development.

   Extended PyEdPro to create a work log. It now saves a work log and timestamps
  of file open / close / write operations. Also session start, session exit.
