 New:

  Added directory search. Looks for strings and displays a summary of matches
  in the current directory. Selecting a file will load it. Most useful for
  development.

  Extended PyEdPro to create a work log. It now saves a work log and timestamps
  of file open / close / write operations. Also session start, session exit.
