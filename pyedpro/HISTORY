                              HISTORY

    This is a non exhaustive list of changes in the PyEdPro project. Git has a more complete
list of logs.

    Sun 05.Sep.2021 -- made it function on the Mac M1 laptop
    Pyedpro now is working good on the Mac. I installed homebrew, and got it to work. It
    was not a trivial exercise, as the Mac pygobject did not do half of the stuff as the
    Linux version did. No asynchronous  anything, segmentation faults everywhere. (which python
    is not suppose to have) So added new async subsystem with threads, and cleaned out
    a lot of parts. The font rendering was messed up, but got fixed by replacing pango's
    get_pixel_size() with get_size() / PANGO_UNIT. [Suspect int vs float accuracy issues]
    Some asyn functions like the function updater is disabled, but it can be done
    manually. (right click on doc -> rescan)
    NOT RECOMMENDED

    Thu Tue 08.Sep.2020   (version 1.4)
    F2 key starts devhelp, and puts you into a search with the
    current selection. For instance if Gtk.DrawingArea is selected,
    the help page of that class comes up. Devhelp must be installed.

UPDATES:

   PyGTK 3 changed a lot of things ... workig on port

   PyGTK 2.24 (latest at the time of writing) has a bug on not delivering
double click to the window. Down-graded to 2.22.x, works flawlessly.

   Lots of functions added. Attempted to make it tablet friendly. Drag
on screen now does what you would expect from a tablet.

   My laptop keyboard broke, so I added Ctrl-H for left arrow j, k, l
for the other arrows (like in vim) so the defective keys are substituted
with vi compatible navigation.

  On request of one of my clients, I needed to create a time sheet. So I
extended PyEdPro to create a work log.

The log contains the following elements:

 Start time, End time, Time of file Open, time of file Save.
The files have been created to be machine parsable.

 Example log entry:

Action: Started PyEdPro
On: Tue May 08 16:44:37 2018

Action: Ended PyEdPro
On: Tue May 08 17:14:21 2018
Time diff: 1784 0:29

 Example timesheet entry:

 Action: Opened File C:\msys32\home\peterglen\esp\esp-code\wclock\v010\common\v000\httpd.c
On: Thu Jun 28 14:49:13 2018
Delta: 0
Date: 1530211753 httpd.c Opened

Action: Closed File C:\msys32\home\peterglen\esp\esp-code\wclock\v010\common\v000\httpd.c
On: Thu Jun 28 14:49:18 2018
Delta: 5
Date: 1530211759 httpd.c Closed

 The files are located at ~/.PyEdPro/log/account.txt and ~/.PyEdPro/log/timesheet.txt
 (the '~/' stands for your home directory. On windows it is
 C:\Users\<UserName>\ ...) Example: 'C:\Users\PeterGlen\.PyEdPro\'

UPDATES:

  Implemented multiple clipboards. The key combination Ctrl-0 to Ctrl-8 switches
clipboard buffers. Switching to buffer 9 (Ctrl-9) yields the sum of all clipboards
from 1-8. This is useful on collecting parts of the file, and unifying it
with one keystroke.  (Like collecting function headers.) The first clipboard buffer
(Ctrl-0) is the same as the OS clipboard.

UPDATES:

  sep/16/2018   Port to GTP3 started
  oct/10/2018   Port stable, almost done
