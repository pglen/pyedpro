\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md12}{}\doxysection{Twincore}\label{index_autotoc_md12}
Database with two files. One for data, one for index;

The reason for this name is that two files are created. The first contains the data, the second contains the offsets (indexes) and hashes.

The second file can be re-\/built easily from the first using the reindex option.

Structure of the data\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}32 byte header, starating with FILESIG;

4 bytes    4 bytes          4 bytes         Variable
------------------------------------------------------------
RECSIG     Hash_of_key      Len_of_key      DATA_for_key
RECSEP     Hash_of_payload  Len_of_payload  DATA_for_payload

    .

RECSIG     Hash_of_key      Len_of_key      DATA_for_key
RECSEP     Hash_of_payload  Len_of_payload  DATA_for_payload
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Deleted records are marked with RECSIG mutated from RECB to RECX

New data is appended to the end, no duplicate filtering is done. Retrieval is searched from reverse, the latest record with this key is retrieved first.

Verbosity\+: (use the \textquotesingle{}-\/v\textquotesingle{} option multiple times) \begin{DoxyVerb}0 =  no output
1 =  normal, some items printed, short record ;
2 =  more detail; full record (-vv)
3 =  more detail + damaged records (-vvv)
\end{DoxyVerb}
 Debug\+: (use the \textquotesingle{}-\/d\textquotesingle{} option with number) \begin{DoxyVerb}0 =  no output
1 =  normal, some items
2 =  more details
\end{DoxyVerb}
 History\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}Sat 04.Feb.2023     --  Converted from CURRDATA to ftell
