                                   INSTALL

   Just copy the files anywhere and type ./pyedpro.py The only pre-requisite
 is to have the pyedlib sub directory in the same directory as pyedpro.py

  PyEdpro requires GTK3, PyGobject and related libraries. Most distros
come with them pre-installed, so PyEdPro.py should run on most any system
including Linux, Windoze and Macz. One of the motivations, of course is to
have the same text editor on all platforms.

 (PyEdPro is extensively tested on UBU/FEDO Linux, Raspberry PI and Windows)

To install pygtk3 on python 2/3 issue the msys32/64 commands:

    pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-gtk3 mingw-w64-i686-python2-gobject \
                 mingw-w64-i686-python3-gobject

Or on 64 bit:   (support incomplete as of dec/2018 - now complete (may/2019))

    pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-python3-gobject python-gi-cairo

To install pyedpro on Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install python-gi python-gi-cairo python3-gi python3-gi-cairo \
            gir1.2-gtk-3.0

To install pyedpro on Windows:

    Download and install python 2.7
    Download and install pygobject for windows.

  Links (may/2019):

        Python:
             https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/

        Gobject:
             https://sourceforge.net/projects/pygobjectwin32/

    On the GObject installation point to the python path (c:\python27) and select
        GTK.xx.xx and other packages you may want to install.


    To display the keymap and documentation, PyEdPro needs pangview.py (included)

  If you do not have root access, PyEdPro will run from any directory, provided
that the subdirectory pyedlib is under the directory PyEdPro.py is in.

 You may also install PyEdPro in the user's private bin directory
 (if it is in the user's path) with the command like cp -a * ~/bin

Additional tweaks neede for different platforms:

  On Unix you may need to execute dos2unix pyedpro.py to allow it to run from
command line.

  Some platforms will need the 'python-gi-cairo' module. The symptom is that the
editor's text field remains blank. PyedPro will issue appropriate messages on the
controlling terminal for the missing library, install it with:

  sudo apt install python-gi-cairo


Enjoy.
